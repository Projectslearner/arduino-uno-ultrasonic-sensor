### Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object from the sensor. The sensor emits ultrasonic waves and calculates the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from the object. Based on this time duration, the distance to the object is determined.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Uno**
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Pin Connections

- **Ultrasonic Sensor:**
  - Trig Pin: Connect to digital pin 9 (trigPin) on the Arduino Uno.
  - Echo Pin: Connect to digital pin 10 (echoPin) on the Arduino Uno.
  - VCC: Connect to Arduino 5V.
  - GND: Connect to Arduino GND.

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the trig pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 9 (trigPin) on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 10 (echoPin) on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to Arduino 5V and GND pin to Arduino GND.

2. **Initialize the System:**
   - Set trigPin as an output and echoPin as an input in the setup function.
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.

3. **Measure Distance:**
   - Send a 10 microsecond pulse to the trig pin of the sensor to initiate the measurement.
   - Measure the duration of the pulse received on the echo pin using the `pulseIn()` function.
   - Calculate the distance using the formula: `distance = (duration * 0.0343) / 2`, where 0.0343 is the speed of sound in centimeters per microsecond.

4. **Output Results:**
   - Print the calculated distance to the Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring.

5. **Adjustments:**
   - Modify the delay time according to the desired frequency of distance measurements.
   - Ensure proper alignment and calibration of the ultrasonic sensor for accurate distance readings.

#### Applications

- **Obstacle Detection:** Use the setup for obstacle detection in robotics projects or smart devices.
- **Parking Assistance Systems:** Implement distance sensing in parking assistance systems for vehicles.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Utilize the project for proximity sensing applications in automation and security systems.

#### Notes

- Keep the ultrasonic sensor's orientation stable and ensure it is facing towards the object whose distance is being measured.
- Adjust the speed of sound value in the calculation based on environmental factors if necessary.
